1. Do some research about the different approaches to deployment. What  are the pros and cons of each? When would you use each approach?  

  Answers:

 - Parallel Deployment

-  In this approach, the old and new systems operate in parallel when the new system is first introduced. 
   After a while, once the new system is stable, the old system is switched off.  

- Advantages:

   --> In order to ensure correctness, the old- and new system can be compared with regards to output.
   --> There is little risk of losing data since the old- and new system is used/running.

- Disadvantages:

   --> More time consuming since users must enter data into two different systems.
   --> The data could be diffent in two different systems if the is extensive data entry.

 - Phased Deployment

  -  In this approach, the new system is deployed in phases while the old system is still running. 
     Once the new system is fully integrated and stable, the old system is switched off.  
    
 - Advantages:

   --> Training can be completed in small parts.
   --> A failure of the new system has minimal impact because it is only one small part
   --> Scalling isues can be addressed without major impact.

- Disadvantages
    
   --> This approach (phased deployment) takes more time to get the new system fully online in relation to other approaches.
   --> If part of the new system fails, there is a possibility of data loss.

 - Direct Deployment

 - In this approach, the old system is turned off and the new system is quickly installed and made operational.

- Advantages:

   --> If the system is not critical, this can be a good method for implementation.

- Disadvantages:

   --> If you are not sure the system will work, this method of implementation may not be a good idea

Scenarios and the deployment approaches most applicable:

2.  A second-hand book shop is converting from a paper system to digital, and they've asked you to develop their catalogue software.  After finishing, how do you deploy it and why? 

Answer:

 - Direct deployment will be used here. 
   Since the old system is a paper system the new system can be implemented digitally and thus other deployment approaches will not be needed.

3. A large retail chain has asked you to develop a more modern set of  tools for their use, including point-of-sale systems, stock records,  and customer service systems. After finishing, how do you deploy it  and why? 

Answer: 

- Since the retail chain is large in terms of systems that need update such as the mentioned stock records- and customer service sytems, phased deployment
 with elements of the new system introduced in parts will suffice, while the old system is still running.

4. You have developed an alternate fire alarm system for a large  shopping centre. This system's reliability is of utmost importance.  
    After finishing, how do you deploy it and why? 

Answer:

- Since the fire alarm - whether old or new, current or alternative - must always be in use and reliable, 
a paralell deployment approach is needed where the old- and new (alternative) fire alarm system
run in conjuction until the utmost reliability of such fire alarm system is established.
